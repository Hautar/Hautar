- 👋 Hi, I’m @Hautar
- 👀 I’m interested in C# programming and Unity Game Development, Plasma Physics, Plasma Medicine, games and more.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Unity3D and C# for game development
- 💞️ Looking for a Junior Unity position.

- I graduated from Saint-Petersburg State University in 2021 achieving my Master's Degree in Applied Physics and Mathematics. 
- While graduating I've finished "C# Programming for Unity Game Development Specialization" on Coursera building game prototypes and programming homework projects. (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/programming-unity-game-development)
- In the last studying year I also managed to create my own game "Kolobok RJ".
- Because the game represents my Unity knowledge and I gained a lot of experience making it I think it deserves the first place in my portfolio.
