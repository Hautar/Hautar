- 👋 Hi, I’m @Hautar
- 👀 I’m interested in C# programming and Unity Game Development, Plasma Physics, Plasma Medicine, games and more.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Unity3D and C# for game development
- 💞️ Currently, I am looking for a Junior/Middle Unity3D position.

- I graduated from Saint-Petersburg State University in 2021 achieving my Master's Degree in Applied Physics and Mathematics. 
- While graduating I've finished "C# Programming for Unity Game Development Specialization" on Coursera building game prototypes and programming homework projects. (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/programming-unity-game-development)
- In the last studying year I also managed to create my own game "Kolobok RJ" part of which you can play for free here.
- I implemented all in game systems, such as managing save data, ads, in game purchases, whole gameplay system, animations, scene transitions, etc. 
- Because the game represents my Unity3D knowledge and I gained a lot of experience making it I think it deserves the first plays in my portfolio.
- So, I hope you will be satisfied with my knowledge and offer me Junior/Middle Unity3D developer job interview in your company.
